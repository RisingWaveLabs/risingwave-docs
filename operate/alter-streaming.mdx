## Alter a table or source

To add or drop columns from a table or source, simply use the [ALTER TABLE](/sql/commands/sql-alter-table) or [ALTER SOURCE](/sql/commands/sql-alter-source) command. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN birth_date date;

ALTER SOURCE customers ADD COLUMN birth_date date;

```

The new column will be `NULL` for existing records.

## Alter a materialized view

To alter a materialized view, you need to create a new materialized view and drop the existing one.

For example, suppose we want to add a new column to the materialized view `cust_sales`:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales AS
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_price) AS sales_amount
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id;

```

Here we create a new materialized view `cust_sales_new` with the new column `sales_count`:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales_new AS
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_price) AS sales_amount,
        COUNT(*) AS sales_count -- The new column
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id;

```

After the new materialized view is created, we can drop the old materialized view `cust_sales` and rename `cust_sales_new` to `cust_sales`:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales;
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales_new RENAME TO cust_sales;
```

## Alter a sink

To alter a sink, you will need to create a new sink and drop the old sink. Please check the example from the last section.

If your sink is created based on a materialized view using the `CREATE SINK ... FROM ...` statement, you have the option to specify `without_backfill = true` to exclude existing data.

```
CREATE SINK ... FROM ... WITH (without_backfill = true).
```

## Alter streaming jobs with dependencies

If other materialized views or sinks depend upon the modified materialized view, or if multiple materialized views or sinks with dependencies need updating simultaneously, similarly, create all the new ones and then drop all the old ones.

Let's continue with the previous example, but suppose the upstream `orders` is not a table but another materialized view, derived from tables `order_items` and `price`.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW orders AS
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        SUM(price * quantity) AS total_price
    FROM order_items, price
    WHERE order_items.product_id = price.product_id
    GROUP BY order_id, customer_id;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales AS
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_price) AS sales_amount
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id;
```

To add a new column `sales_count` to `cust_sales`, we need to create the new materialized views `cust_sales_new` and `orders_new` first:

  <img src="/images/current/alter-streaming/streaming-with-dependencies-create-new.svg"/>
</Frame>

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW orders_new AS
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        SUM(price * quantity) AS total_price,
        COUNT(*) AS item_count -- The new column
    FROM order_items, price
    WHERE order_items.product_id = price.product_id
    GROUP BY order_id, customer_id;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales_new AS
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        SUM(total_price) AS sales_amount,
        SUM(item_count) AS sales_count -- The new column
    FROM orders_new -- the new one
    GROUP BY customer_id;
```

After the new materialized views are created, we can drop the old materialized view `cust_sales` and rename `cust_sales_new` to `cust_sales`:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales;
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW cust_sales_new RENAME TO cust_sales;

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW orders;
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW orders_new RENAME TO orders;
```

## Modifying a Streaming Job in place

Only `SINK INTO TABLE` supports modifying the streaming job logic in-place. `SINK INTO TABLE` decouples the streaming processing logic from the persistence layer (the materialization step).

For instance, the following materialized view can be converted into sink into table:
```
create materialized view m1 as select id, v1 from t;

-- converted to sink into table
create table m1_store (id int primary key, v1 int) ON CONFLICT OVERWRITE;
create sink m1_stream into m1_Store as select id, v1 from t;
```

Why don't we always just use sink into table then? Because there can be performance implications. Materialized Views can always trust their upstreams to issue consistent records (e.g. no double inserts to the same PK, no double deletes on the same PK). However, tables can have multiple sinks which sink records into them. Between these sinks, there can be conflicts. This means that tables need to do conflict resolution. Notice how we add `ON CONFLICT OVERWRITE` above, that indicates that if there's a conflict we will overwrite the old record with the new one.

This trade-off means we can dynamically change the sinks into tables, but we have to pay some performance penalty for conflict resolution.

### Example

Given the table t:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t(v1 int);
```

Let's consider a Materialized View:
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW m1 as select count(*) from t;
```

And we want to change it to:
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW m2 as select count(*), max(v1) from t;
```

Clearly the output schema has changed from `int` to `int, int`.

Because it's a Materialized View, if there's some downstream jobs to it, we can't simply drop and recreate it, the downstream jobs must also be dropped since they depend on `m1`.
So let's convert it to use `SINK INTO TABLE`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE m1_store(key int primary key, cnt int) ON CONFLICT OVERWRITE; -- sink into table requires a primary key, so we just add a dummy column
                                                                           -- ON CONFLICT clause will handle conflicts between old and
                                                                           -- updated records from new streaming job.

CREATE SINK m1_stream INTO m1_store AS SELECT 1 as key, count(*) as cnt from t;
```

Next, we wanted to add a `max(v1)` column.

So first we need to alter the table and add a column to it:
```sql
ALTER TABLE m1_store ADD COLUMN max int DEFAULT 0;
```

Next, we can drop the old streaming job:
```
DROP SINK m1_stream;
```

And replace it with the new definition:
```
CREATE SINK m1_stream INTO m1_store AS SELECT 1 as key, count(*) as cnt, max(v1) as max from t;
```

## Why is it not possible to modify an MV in place?

Streaming systems like RisingWave need to maintain **internal state** for streaming operators, such as joins and aggregations. Generally, modifying a materialized view would require consistent changes to the internal state accordingly, which is not always feasible. Let’s see an example.

Given a table `adult_users` that tracks the number of users aged ≥ 18.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW adult_users AS
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as user_count
  FROM users
  WHERE age >= 18;
```

It was discovered later that the legal definition for adulthood should be set at ≥16\. Initially, one might consider modifying the filter condition from `age >= 18` to `age >= 16` as a straightforward solution. However, this is not feasible in stream processing since records with ages between 16 and 18 have already been filtered out. Therefore, the only option to restore the missing data is to recompute the entire stream from the beginning.

Therefore, we recommend persistently storing the source data in a long-term storage solution, such as [a RisingWave table](/sql/commands/sql-create-table). This allows for the recomputation of the materialized view when altering the logic becomes necessary.
