* You can create a database user when [connecting to a project](/cloud/connect-to-a-project/).
* You can click **Create user** in the **Users** tab on the [project details page](/cloud/check-status-and-metrics/#check-project-details) to create a new user.
* You can run the [CREATE USER](/docs/current/sql-create-user/) command to create a new user after [connecting to a project](/cloud/connect-to-a-project/) using the console or terminal.
Ensure that you have logged in to the project with a user that has the `CREATEUSER` privilege. A super user has all privileges, including `CREATEUSER`.
