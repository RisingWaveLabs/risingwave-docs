## Check all project

To browse each project's configuration and running status in your account, go to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/).

In **Projects**, you can see all the projects in your account and [control their running states](/cloud/stop-and-delete-projects/). You can also check the current plan, RisingWave version, region, and creation time of each project here.

## Check project details

To enter the project details page and check the information, such as current activities and resource usage, and monitor all metrics of a project, go to [**Projects**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/project/home/) and click on the project.

The project details page includes:

* Current activities
* Current usage
* Configuration details
* Metrics
   * Key indicators — CPU usage, memory usage, throughput, storage usage, and network
   * Streaming — barrier latency, in-flight barrier number, backfilling throughput, backpressure rate
   * Query — query per second, query average latency
   * UDF — UDF call count, UDF latency, UDF throughput

**TIP**

To specify the time range of the metrics, go to the **Metrics** tab, and click on **Last 30 minutes** in the top right corner to customize your time range.
