description: A project in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a project, you can create and manage database users and databases.

> Currently, access to a project is restricted to one RisingWave Cloud account and cannot be shared among multiple accounts. Future releases will introduce organizational support, allowing for managing multiple accounts and their access to individual projects.
