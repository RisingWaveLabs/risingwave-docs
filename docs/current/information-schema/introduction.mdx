## Tables

The `information_schema.tables` view contains all tables, views, sinks, and materialized views defined in the current database.

<Info>
**NOTE**

Materialized views are specific to the information schema of RisingWave. They are not included in the information schema of PostgreSQL.
</Info>

The `information_schema.tables` view contains the following columns.

| Column               | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| table\_schema        | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the table, view, or materialized view. The default schema for user-created objects is public.                                                                        |
| table\_name          | varchar | Name of the table, view, or materialized view                                                                                                                                                         |
| table\_type          | varchar | Type of the table, view, or materialized view. BASE TABLE for a user-defined table, VIEW for a non-materialized view, MATERIALIZED VIEW for a materialized view, and SYSTEM TABLE for a system table. |
| is\_insertable\_into | varchar | YES if the table or view is insertable into, NO if not. User-defined tables are always insertable, while views and materialized views are not necessarily.                                            |

## Views

The `information_schema.views` view contains information about the views in the database.

It contains the following columns.

| Column           | Type    | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| table\_catalog   | varchar | Name of the current database              |
| table\_schema    | varchar | Name of the schema that contains the view |
| table\_name      | varchar | Name of the view                          |
| view\_definition | varchar | SQL statement that defines the view       |

<Info>
**TEMPORARY LIMITATION**

Users with access to `information_schema.views` can potentially access all views, which poses a security risk. We are working to resolve this limitation. Once the fix is implemented, this message will be removed.
</Info>

## Columns

The `information_schema.columns` view contains information about columns of all tables, views, and materialized views in the database.

| Column                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                          |

## How to use the information schema views?

You can use various information schema views to determine the makeup of tables, sinks, views, and materialized views in a database.

For example, you can query for names and types of all the tables, views, and materialized views in the current database:

```sql
SELECT table_name, table_type
FROM information_schema.tables;
```

To query for all of the columns in a table, sink, view, or materialized view called `taxi_trip`:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name='taxi_trip';
```

To find out tables, sinks, views, and materialized views that contain a column called `trip_id`:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name='trip_id';
```
