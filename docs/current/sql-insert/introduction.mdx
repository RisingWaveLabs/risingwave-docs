title: "INSERT"
description: "Use the `INSERT` command to insert new rows into an existing table."
---

<Note>
**INFO**

* For tables with primary keys, if you insert a row with an existing key, the new row will overwrite the existing row.
* Call [FLUSH](/docs/current/sql-flush/) after `INSERT` to persist the changes to storage. This ensures that the changes are committed and visible for subsequent reads.
</Note>

## Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name [ ( col_name [ , ... ] ) ]
      { VALUES ( value [ , ... ] ) [ , ( ... ) ] | select_query }
      [ RETURNING col_name ];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter or clause | Description                                                                                                                                                        |

| _table\_name_       | The table where you want to insert rows.                                                                                                                           |
| _col\_name_         | The column where you want to insert corresponding values.  Currently, you must provide all columns in the table in order or leave this field empty.                |
| _value_             | An expression or value to assign to the corresponding column.  You can use [DESCRIBE](/docs/current/sql-describe/) to check the order of the columns in the table. |
| _select\_query_     | A [SELECT](/docs/current/sql-select/) statement that returns the rows you want to insert to the table.                                                             |

## Example

The table `taxi_trips` has three columns:

```sql
{
  "id": INT NOT NULL,
  "distance": DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  "city": VARCHAR
}
```

The following statement inserts four new rows into `taxi_trips`.

```sql
INSERT INTO taxi_trips
    VALUES
      (1,16,'Dallas'),
      (2,23,'New York'),
      (3,6,'Chicago'),
      (4,9,NULL);
```

Let's query the table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM taxi_trips ORDER BY id;
```

```bash
 id | distance |   city
----+----------+----------
  1 |       16 | Dallas
  2 |       23 | New York
  3 |        6 | Chicago
  4 |        9 |
```

The following statement inserts all rows in another table name `taxi_trips_new` into `taxi_trips`. The two tables have the same column setup. Also, it returns the value of _id_ for the inserted rows.

```sql
INSERT INTO taxi_trips
    SELECT * FROM taxi_trips_new
    RETURNING id;
```
