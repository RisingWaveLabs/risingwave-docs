## Comparison operators

| Operator | Expression & Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| \=  | `operand1 = operand2`  <br/>Equal.  <br/>TRUE if the operands separated by = have the same value. | 1 = 1 → t  <br/>'1' = 1 → t  <br/>'a' = 'b' → f  <br/>(1, 0) = (1, 1) → f  <br/>('a', 'b') = ('a', 'b') → t |
| \<>  <br/>!= | `operand1 \<> operand2` or `operand1 != operand2`  <br/>Not equal.  <br/>TRUE if the operands separated by \<> or != have different values. | 1 \<> 1 → f  <br/>'1' != 1 → f  <br/>'a' != 'b' → t  <br/>(1, 0) \<> (1, 1) → t  <br/>('a', 'b') != ('a', 'b') → f |
| \<   | `operand1 < operand2`  <br/>Less than.  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is less than _operand2_. | 0 < 1 → t  <br/>1 < 1 → f |
| \<=  | `operand1 <= operand2`  <br/>Less than or equal to.  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is less than or equal to _operand2_. | 1 \<= 1 → t  \<br/>1 \<= 0 → f |
| \>  | `operand1 > operand2`  <br/>Greater than.  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is greater than _operand2_. | 1 > 0 → t  <br/>1 > 1 → f |
| \>= | `operand1 >= operand2`  <br/>Greater than or equal to.  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is greater than or equal to _operand2_. | 1 >= 1 → t  <br/>0 >= 1 → f |

## Comparison predicate

| Operator | Expression & Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| IS DISTINCT FROM | `operand1 IS DISTINCT FROM operand2`  <br/>Not equal (null comparable).  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is not equal to _operand2_. | 1 IS DISTINCT FROM NULL → t  <br/>1 IS DISTINCT FROM 1 → f |
| IS NOT DISTINCT FROM | `operand1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM operand2`  <br/>Equal (null comparable).  <br/>TRUE if _operand1_ is equal to _operand2_. | 1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM NULL → f |
| BETWEEN ... AND ... | `operand BETWEEN min AND max`  <br/>Between (inclusive range).  <br/>TRUE if the operand is greater than or equal to _min_ and less than or equal to _max_. | 1 BETWEEN 0 AND 1 → t  <br/>'c' BETWEEN 'a' AND 'b' → f |
| NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... | `operand NOT BETWEEN min AND max`  <br/>Not between (inclusive range).  <br/>TRUE if the operand is less than _min_ and greater than _max_. | 1 NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 1 → f |
| IN() | `operand IN (value,...)`  <br/>Whether a value is equal to any of the values you specify.  <br/>TRUE if the operand is equal to one of the specified expressions/values. NULL if the operand is null or if the operand is not in the specified expressions/values that contain a null. | 1 IN (0,1,2,3) → t  <br/>'a' IN ('ab','b','c','d') → f  <br/>null IN (null, 3, 0.5\*2, min(v1)) → NULL  <br/>99 IN (null, 3, 2) → NULL |
| NOT IN() | `operand NOT IN (value,...)`  <br/>Whether a value is not equal to any of the values you specify.  <br/>TRUE if the operand is not equal to any specified expressions/values. | 1 NOT IN (0,1,2,3) → f |
| ANY() | `expression operator ANY (array expression)`  <br/>Compares a value with the element in a set or array of values.  <br/>The right-hand side is a parenthesized expression and must yield an array value. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each element of the array using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result.  <br/>  <br/>TRUE if any true result is obtained. FALSE if no true result is found (including the case where the array has zero elements).  <br/>  <br/>NULL if the array expression yields a null array, or if the left-hand expression yields null (assuming a strict comparison operator), or if the right-hand array contains any null elements and no true comparison result is obtained (assuming a strict comparison operator). | 5 = ANY(ARRAY\[1, 3, 5, 7\]) → t |
| SOME() | `expression operator SOME (array expression)`  <br/>SOME is a synonym for ANY. | 5 = SOME(ARRAY\[1, 3, 5, 7\]) → t |
| ALL() | `expression operator ALL (array expression)`  <br/>Compares a value with the element in a set or array of values.  <br/>The right-hand side is a parenthesized expression and must yield an array value. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each element of the array using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result.  <br/>  <br/>TRUE if all comparisons yield true (including the case where the array has zero elements). FALSE if any false result is found.  <br/>  <br/>NULL if the array expression yields a null array, or if the left-hand expression yields null (assuming a strict comparison operator), or if the right-hand array contains any null elements and no false comparison result is obtained(assuming a strict comparison operator). | 5 > ALL(ARRAY\[1, 3, 5, 7\]) → f |
| IS TRUE | `boolean IS TRUE`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression is true. | true IS TRUE → t  <br/>null::boolean IS TRUE → f |
| IS NOT TRUE | `boolean IS NOT TRUE`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression is false or unknown. | true IS NOT TRUE → f  <br/>null::boolean IS NOT TRUE → t |
| IS FALSE | `boolean IS FALSE`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression is false. | true IS FALSE → f  <br/>null::boolean IS FALSE → f |
| IS NOT FALSE | `boolean IS NOT FALSE`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression is true or unknown. | true IS NOT FALSE → t  <br/>null::boolean IS NOT FALSE → t |
| IS NULL | `value IS NULL`  <br/>Whether a value is null. | 1 IS NULL → f |
| IS NOT NULL | `value IS NOT NULL`  <br/>Whether a value is not null. | 1 IS NOT NULL → t |
| IS UNKNOWN | `boolean IS UNKNOWN`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression returns an unknown value (typically represented by a null). | null IS UNKNOWN → t  <br/>false IS UNKNOWN → f |
| IS NOT UNKNOWN | `boolean IS NOT UNKNOWN`  <br/>Whether a boolean expression returns true or false. | true IS NOT UNKNOWN → t  <br/>null IS NOT UNKNOWN → f |
