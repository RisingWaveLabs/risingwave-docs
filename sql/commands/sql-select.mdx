title: "SELECT"
description: "Use the `SELECT` command to retrieve rows from a table or materialized view. It returns the rows that satisfy the criteria that you specify with the clauses and conditions in your query."
---

## Syntax

```js
[ WITH clause ]
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON ( expression [, ...] ) ]] [ [table_name.]* [ EXCEPT ( [table_name.]except_column, ... ] ) ] | expression [ AS output_name ] [ , expression [ AS output_name ] ... ] ]
    [ VALUES clause ]
    [ FROM from_item [ , from_item ...] ]
    [ WHERE condition ]
    [ GROUP BY grouping_expression [ , grouping_expression ... ] ]
    [ HAVING condition ]
    [ ORDER BY sort_expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [ , ... ] ]
    [ LIMIT count_number ]
    [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ];
```

Where `from_item` can be:

```js
    table_name  [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ]
    window_type ( table_name, col_name, interval_expression ) [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ]
    ( SELECT ) [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ]
    from_item join_type from_item [ ON join_condition ]
```

| **WITH** clause        | Provides a way to write supplemental statements for a larger query. For more information, see [WITH clause](/sql/query-syntax/with-clause).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **DISTINCT** clause    | This clause eliminates duplicate rows from the result. SELECT DISTINCT eliminates duplicate rows based on **all selected columns**. SELECT DISTINCT ON allows you to specify expressions or columns and returns only the first row for each unique combination. It requires the use of the ORDER BY clause to determine the first row, and the DISTINCT ON expression must match the leftmost ORDER BY expression. The ORDER BY clause will normally contain additional expressions that determine the desired precedence of rows within each DISTINCT ON group. In this case, this expression can be an alternative with group [topN](/docs/current/sql-pattern-topn/) when "N=1". See [examples of this clause](#distinct-clause) below to know more about it. |
| **EXCEPT** clause      | Exclude one or more columns from the result set. By specifying _except\_column_, the query will return all columns in the result set except those specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Examples

### `DISTINCT` clause
Here is an example of `SELECT DISTINCT`. This query will return only the unique combinations of `first_name` and `last_name`, eliminating any duplicate rows.

```sql
-- Retrieve the names of employees.
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;
```

Here is an example of `SELECT DISTINCT ON`. The query returns the latest order for each unique `customer_id`. `ORDER BY` is used to ensure that the desired row, that is, the row with the latest order date, appears first; otherwise, the returned row will be unpredictable.

```sql
-- Retrieve the latest order for each unique customer.
SELECT DISTINCT ON (customer_id) order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount
FROM orders
ORDER BY customer_id, order_date DESC;
```

### Example of using several clauses
Below are the tables within the same schema that we will be writing queries from.

The table `taxi_trips` includes the columns `id`, `distance`, `duration`, and `fare`, where `id` identifies each unique trip.

```yaml
{
  "id": VARCHAR,
  "distance": DOUBLE PRECISION,
  "duration": DOUBLE PRECISION,
  "fare": DOUBLE PRECISION
}
```

The table `taxi` includes the columns `taxi_id` and `trip_id`, where `trip_id` and `id` in `taxi_trips` are matching fields.

```yaml
{
  "taxi_id": VARCHAR,
  "trip_id": VARCHAR
}
```

The table `company` includes the columns `company_id` and `taxi_id`, where `taxi_id` and `taxi_id` in `taxi` are matching fields.

```yaml
{
  "company_id": VARCHAR,
  "taxi_id": VARCHAR
}
```

The following query returns the total distance and duration of trips that are beyond the initial charge ($2.50) of each taxi from the company "Yellow Taxi" and "FabCab".

```sql
SELECT
    taxi.taxi_id,
    sum(trips.distance) AS total_distance,
    sum(trips.duration) AS total_duration
FROM taxi_trips AS trips
LEFT JOIN taxi ON trips.id = taxi.trip_id
WHERE taxi_id IN (
          SELECT taxi_id
          FROM company
          WHERE company_id IN ('Yellow Taxi', 'FabCab')
      )
      AND trips.fare > 2.50
GROUP BY taxi_id
ORDER BY total_distance, total_duration;
```
