title: "ALTER SWAP"
---

The `ALTER ... SWAP` command enables the exchange of names between two database objects, such as tables, materialized views, views, sources, sinks, or subscriptions. It simplifies the process of renaming two objects by allowing them to be swapped in a single operation.

<Note>
The objects being swapped must be of the same type; otherwise, an error will be returned.

## Parameter
