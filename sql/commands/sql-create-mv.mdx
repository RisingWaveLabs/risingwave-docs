title: "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW"
description: "Use the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` command to create a materialized view. A materialized view can be created based on sources, tables, materialized views, or indexes."
---

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] mv_name AS select_query;
```

<Tip>
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` will first **backfill** historical data from the referenced relations, and completion time varies based on the volume of data to be backfilled.

To perform the operations in the background, you can execute `SET BACKGROUND_DDL=true;` before running the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement. See details in [SET BACKGROUND\_DDL](/sql/commands/sql-set-background-ddl).
</Tip>
## Parameters

| Parameter or clause | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _mv\_name_          | The name of the materialized view to be created.                                                                                                         |
| _select\_query_     | A SELECT query that retrieves data for the materialized view. See [SELECT](/docs/current/sql-select/) for the syntax and examples of the SELECT command. |

<Note>
Names and unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive. Therefore, you must double-quote any of these fields for them to be case-sensitive. See also [Identifiers](/docs/current/sql-identifiers/).
</Note>

<Note>
The `ORDER BY` clause in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement is allowed but not considered as part of the definition of the materialized view. It's only used in the initial creation of the materialized view and not during refreshes.
</Note>

## Examples

Refer to this [tutorial](/docs/current/server-performance-anomaly-detection/) for examples of creating materialized views based on external sources or existing materialized views.
