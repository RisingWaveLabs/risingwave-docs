We aim to minimize the hassle of integrating RisingWave with your existing data stack. With that purpose in mind, we will try to support the mainstream data formats, tools, and as many systems as possible.

Check the currently available sources, destinations, and visualization tools provided by us. If there is a crucial connector or integration that is not supported, please [submit a feature request](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature&template=feature%5Frequest.yml) or let us know in the [RisingWave Slack workspace](https://www.risingwave.com/slack). We will prioritize development based on the number of requests for each system.
