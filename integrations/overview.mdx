title: "Integrations"
description: "We aim to minimize the hassle of integrating RisingWave with your existing data stack. With that purpose in mind, we will try to support the mainstream data formats, tools, and as many systems as possible."
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

However, with limited resources, we cannot achieve this goal in a short period. If a connector or integration is crucial to you but has not been supported, please let us know in the [RisingWave Slack workspace](https://www.risingwave.com/slack), or by clicking the thumb-up icon in the corresponding cell on this page. We will prioritize the development based on the number of requests for each system.

If you wish to receive notifications when a connector or integration is available, you can click the small bell icon to enter your email address.

For tools or integrations that you would like to use but are not listed in the tables below, you can [submit a feature request](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature&template=feature%5Frequest.yml), or let us know in the Slack workspace.

<Info>
**NOTE ABOUT SINK STATUS**

RisingWave can sink data to Kafka. This allows indirectly sinking data to any system that can ingest from Kafka. The tables below show the direct sink status:

"Available" means a direct sink connector exists for that system.

"Researching" means no direct sink yet, but the system can still be used if it can ingest from Kafka.
